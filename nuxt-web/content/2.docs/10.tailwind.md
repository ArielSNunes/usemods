# Tailwind Plugin
We have a Tailwind plugin that adds our device classes to your Tailwind config. It's really simple to use, which is why our docs are so short. Plus writing is hard.

## Use addDeviceClass
First, you need to add the `addDeviceClass` function to your project. This function will add the device class to the `body` tag. I'll leave it up to you to decide how where to put it.

```js
@import { addDeviceClass } from 'usemods'
```

## Add the Tailwind plugin

```js
const { modDevices } = require('./utils/tailwind')

module.exports = {
    // The rest of your config
    plugins: [
        // The rest of your plugins
        modDevices,
    ],
}
```

## Use the classes
Now you can use the classes in your HTML. Here's an example:

```html
<div class="hidden ios:flex">Show on iOS</div>
<div class="hidden android:flex">Show on Android</div>
<div class="hidden chrome:flex">Show on Chrome</div>
<div class="hidden safari:flex">Show on Safari</div>
<div class="hidden firefox:flex">Show on Firefox</div>
<div class="hidden edge:flex">Oh...you use Edge? Like, does work make you?</div>
```
